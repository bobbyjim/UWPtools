# UWP Tools
Perl and Raku modules and scripts for UWP manipulation

# Raku
This is the newer, fresher material, using Raku classes to try to manage the data better. I'm working on two processes:

## transform-virus.raku
This script takes a sector and applies the Virus Collapse effects from TNE to it.

## transform-wave.raku
This script takes a sector and applies the Wave Collapse effects from the Galaxiad to it.

## Sector Collapse Configuration
Each sector may have its own configuration file which provides hints to the collapse processes regarding special zones that don't follow the standard rules.

# Perl
This is a collection of various UWP modules and scripts, including a CGI script that was used for worldbuilding calculations.

There is a set of modules for generating an entire solar system using T5 Book 3 rules.

There are utilities here as well.
